This is my simple webserver for testing web apps locally on my mac


This folder is the root where my web server looks for website files.

### My Node-based Webserver
start it in this folder, from the terminal, like this: node my_nodeserver
it will start listening on port 8000.
then browse to localhost:8000 to load the index.html in this folder.
